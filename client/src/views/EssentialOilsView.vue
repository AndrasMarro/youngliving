        <p>
          Essential oils are concentrated extracts harvested from plants, herbs, and trees, which
          are carefully steam distilled or cold pressed. These pure, precious oils are more potent
          than the botanicals from which they're extracted and contain powerful, concentrated health
          and wellness benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you use oils for aromatherapy, personal care, or as household solutions, all
          aspects of your life will get a boost with a few drops of essential oils!
